                <p class="section-subtitle">What we build together</p>
            </div>
            <div class="philosophy-content">
                <div class="philosophy-text">
                    <p class="lead">The NYDT Dog isn't just well-behaved. They're mentally stimulated, physically fulfilled, and genuinely connected to their person. They're not suppressing their nature—they're channeling it.</p>
                    
                    <p>We take a holistic approach because your dog is a whole being, not a set of problems to fix. That means we look at everything: mental enrichment, physical wellness, emotional security, and the quality of communication between you two.</p>
                    
                    <p>Training is just the beginning. We're here for the whole relationship—the frustrating adolescent phase, the life transitions, the breakthrough moments when everything clicks. Because this isn't a six-week program that ends. It's about establishing a partnership that lasts.</p>

                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p>Your dog is always talking. We teach you to listen—and respond in ways they understand.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pillar">
                        <h3>Partnership</h3>
                        <p>This is a relationship, not a hierarchy. We build trust, not compliance.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pillar">
                        <h3>Love</h3>
                        <p>Real training starts with affection and bond. Positive reinforcement works because your dog wants to connect with you, not because they fear consequences.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pillar">
                        <h3>Patience</h3>
                        <p>You need to be a patient guide while your dog learns, makes mistakes, and improves. There's no magic bullet—just consistent, compassionate work.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="pillar">
                        <h3>Enrichment</h3>
