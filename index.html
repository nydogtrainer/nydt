                    <p class="lead">The NYDT Dog isn't just well-behaved. They're mentally stimulated, physically fulfilled, and genuinely connected to their person. They're not suppressing their nature—they're channeling it.</p>
                    
                    <p>We take a holistic approach because your dog is a whole being, not a set of problems to fix. That means we look at everything: mental enrichment, physical wellness, emotional security, and the quality of communication between you two.</p>
                    
                    <p>Training is just the beginning. We're here for the whole relationship—the frustrating adolescent phase, the life transitions, the breakthrough moments when everything clicks. Because this isn't a six-week program that ends. It's about establishing a partnership that lasts.</p>
